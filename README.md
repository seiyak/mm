mm - modify make
==

MM is a part of my web search engine project called, sse. What it does is check dependencies and rewrite Makefiles with the updated dependencies. It is only for the sse project and I don't think that it's useful for other projects.

I'm aware of make with auto dependency but I can't make it work. Probably a little bit later, I'll study it and use it on the project. However, as long as Makefiles are consistent somehow, it's easy to transform them to Makefiles with auto dependency.
